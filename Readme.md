Trigger Snap
============

Tool to automate taking screenshot of screen region.

There are three modes of operation:

 - Take single screenshot: freezes screen and lets user select the region
   to be saved.
 - Take screenshot sequence: take multiple screenshots of a pre-defined
   screen region.
 - Scrape document: special mode to convert documents into a series
   of images. Can be helpful to store copy-protected PDF documents... ;-)
